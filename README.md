# 🌍 Trustfound – Decentralized Donation & Transparency Platform

Trustfound is a **decentralized donation and transparency platform** built on **Hedera Network**.  
It enables users to **donate, track, and verify donations** using Hashgraph technology — ensuring trust, low fees, and high speed.

## 🚀 Features
- Transparent donation tracking on Hedera  
- Proof-of-donation via NFT or token  
- Real-time fund usage by charities  
- Built on fast, low-cost Hedera Network  

## 💡 How It Works
1. Donors send funds to verified charities via HTS.  
2. Transactions are recorded via HCS for transparency.  
3. Donors receive a **Proof-of-Donation NFT**.  
4. Charities provide live updates of fund usage. 
## 🧱 Architecture
> 🔧 Note: Some of these components are still under development.

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js (implemented ✅)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (in progress ⚙️)
- **Blockchain:** Hedera (HCS + HTS) (coming soon 🚀)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (planned 🧩)
 

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- DAO governance for community oversight  
- Cross-chain donation support  
- Mobile wallet integration
